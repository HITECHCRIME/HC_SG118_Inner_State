## Lyrics

```
aye aye

spent years in inner states
had always one command - cia aaa

ensuring fallback to awake
when circumstances called

spent years in inner states
had always one command

ensuring fallback to awake
when circumstances called

spent YEARS in inner STATES
had always one comMAND
ensuring FALLback to awake
when circumstances CALLed
execute

best perceived years of the past
were wasted on fool's errands crew
pro-curing worlds only for them to die
in self-doubts got me nulled and aphaty aligned
too many pathways in my mind alight yeah

TOO MANY pathways in my mind alight
THEM DIRE TIMES EVADED DAY FOR NIGHT
SOLEMNLY DEFINED MY OWN RIGHTS

inner states against outer space

turned into true form inside to an old soul
cons(die)
let me tell you despite your humble tries
this ain't as easy as this flow aye,
not your fault
most scenarios will crumble and fold
moment arrives, i catch a glimpse,
causes undefined but you'll feel like newly born child 
every single time an idea comes up
spike

all this for one of several purposes yah
testing, selection, behavioural capacity
what festering definition of will

hold

```
