## Lyrics

```

spent years in inner states
had always one command

ensuring fallback to awake
when circumstances called

spent years in inner states
had always one command

ensuring fallback to awake
when circumstances called

spent years in inner states
had always one command
ensuring fallback to awake
when circumstances called

best perceived years of the past
were wasted on fool's errands, true 
but
procuring worlds only for them to die
in self-doubts got me nulled and aphatic alight (aligned)
too many pathways in my mind alight

turned my form inside to an old soul (die)
let me tell you despite your humble tries 
this ain't as easy as this flow, not your fault
most scenarios will crumble and fold
moment arrives, i catch a glimpse,
causes undefined but you'll feel like newly born child 
every single time an idea comes up
spike

all this for one of several purposes yah
testing, selection, behavioural capacity
what festering definition of will

hold

```
