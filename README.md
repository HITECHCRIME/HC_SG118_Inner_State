## Lyrics

```
aye aye

spent years in inner states
had always one command - cia aaa

ensuring fallback to awake
when circumstances called

spent years in inner states
had always one command

ensuring fallback to awake
when circumstances called

spent YEARS in inner STATES
had always one comMAND
ensuring FALLback to awake
when circumstances CALLed
execute

best perceived years of the past
were wasted on fool's errands crew
pro-curing worlds only for them to die
in self-doubts got me nulled and aphaty aligned
too many pathways in my mind alight yeah

x
so i'm seeing light

TOO MANY pathways in my mind alight
THEM DIRE TIMES EVADED DAY FOR NIGHT
SOLEMNLY DECLINED (DEFINED) MY OWN RIGHTS
in the inner states never scratches against meat space lies derived
neverd derived anything from meat space lies

turned into a true form inside to an old soul
i dieeed let me tell your humble tries then go
not your fault
this ain't as easy as a thought flow 
moment arrives, i catch a glimpse (to unfold)
most scenarios will crumble and fold
causes undefined but you'll feel like wanted to unfold

stories told
folding does
don't think so

splashing bold no?

growth like cold so creepin' 
breaking the last law of
tastes, stakes kept in safes 
KEYMASTER'S WEEPING'

holes don't fit in the cypher
of all the things 
i must've got you tripping
on facts that no longer exist




mind holes in mold shut down




newly born child 
every single time an idea comes up
spike
all this for one of several purposes yah
testing, selection, behavioural capacity
what festering definition of will

hold

```
